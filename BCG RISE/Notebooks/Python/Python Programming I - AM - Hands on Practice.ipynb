    "### 1.1.1 Kernel -> Restart & Run All\n",
    "\n",
    "Using \"Kernel -> Restart & Run All\" in Jupyter Notebook is a helpful command for executing all the code cells in the notebook from start to finish. It restarts the kernel, which clears the memory and starts with a fresh execution environment, and then runs each code cell in sequential order.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good practice to perform `Kernel -> Restart & Run All` and here are some benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Consistent execution: It ensures that all code cells are executed in the same order, without any prior state or interference from previous runs. This helps in obtaining consistent and reliable results, especially when working on a complex notebook with dependencies between cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reproducibility: By running all cells from the beginning, you can easily reproduce the entire notebook's execution and obtain the same results. This is particularly useful when sharing or collaborating on notebooks, as it eliminates any ambiguity regarding cell execution order.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Debugging and error-checking: Running all cells helps identify any issues or errors that might arise due to changes in the notebook's state or cell dependencies. It allows you to catch errors early on and ensure that the notebook executes as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Workflow validation: Running all cells allows you to validate the workflow and logic of your notebook. It helps ensure that each cell executes without errors and produces the desired output, providing confidence in the correctness of the notebook's overall structure and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Time-saving: Running all cells at once eliminates the need to manually execute each cell individually, particularly when working with a large notebook. It saves time and streamlines the process of re-executing the entire notebook when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that \"Kernel -> Restart & Run All\" will reset the notebook's state, which includes clearing variables, resetting imported modules, and erasing any stored data in memory. Therefore, be cautious and save any important data or results before using this command."

    "Using \"Kernel -> Restart & Clear Output\" in Jupyter Notebook is a command that restarts the kernel and clears the output of all code cells in the notebook. It provides a way to reset the notebook's execution state and remove any previously displayed outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good practice to perform `Kernel -> Restart & Clear Output` and here are some benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clean and organized presentation: When preparing a notebook for sharing, publication, or presentation, clearing the output ensures a clean and clutter-free view. It removes all previously executed output cells, making the notebook more readable and focused on the code and explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* File size reduction: Clearing the output helps reduce the file size of the notebook, especially if there are large outputs or plots generated during previous executions. This can be helpful when sharing or storing notebooks with limited storage or bandwidth constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quick rerun without re-execution: If you need to rerun the notebook but don't require the previous outputs, using \"Restart & Clear Output\" provides a way to reset the execution state without the need to re-execute the code cells. This can save time, particularly for long-running notebooks or those with computationally expensive code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Privacy and security: Clearing the output before sharing or distributing a notebook helps ensure that any sensitive or confidential information displayed in previous outputs is not inadvertently disclosed. It helps protect the privacy and security of the data contained within the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Debugging and troubleshooting: When encountering issues or errors in a notebook, using \"Restart & Clear Output\" can be an initial step in the debugging process. By clearing the output and restarting the kernel, you can start with a clean state and isolate the source of the problem more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that using \"Kernel -> Restart & Clear Output\" will reset the notebook's execution state, clearing all output cells. The code cells remain intact, and you can rerun them as needed. However, any variables, imported modules, or stored data in memory will be reset."

    "\n",
    "A variable is a named storage location that holds a value. It acts as a container to store data that can be accessed and manipulated throughout your code. In Python, variables are used to store values that can be referenced and manipulated in your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you declare a variable in Python, you assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=). Here's the general syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "`variable_name = value`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Names with two leading and trailing underscores (e.g., \\__name\\__) generally have special meaning to the Python interpreter, thus avoid this pattern for your own names\n",
    "* Class names usually start with an upper case alphabet\n",
    "* Module names start with a lower case alphabet\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "* Variable names are not declared before being used – but they must be initialized\n",
    "* When a variable is assigned to an object, it references that object\n",
    "* Thus the statement a = 3 does the following :\n",
    "    * create an object to represent the value 3\n",
    "    * create the variable a, if it does not yet exist\n",
    "    * link the variable a to the new object 3 –: a is a reference to 3\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Conceptually each time a new value is generated in script by running an expression, Python creates a new object (a chunk of memory) to represent that value.\n",
    "* As an optimization, Python internally caches and reuses certain kinds of unchangeable objects, such as small integers and strings (each 0 is not really a new piece of memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "* An object is a chunk of memory used to hold :\n",
    "    * the actual object values\n",
    "    * a type designator used to mark the type of the object\n",
    "    * a reference counter used to determine when it’s OK to reclaim the object\n",
    "* Thus the type is associated with the object and not with the variable :\n",
